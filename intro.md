# Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Operations

**CYBERSEC 520 | Fall 2025**

Welcome to the official online course notes for **Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Operations**.

## Course Description
This course explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. **We begin by establishing a solid foundation in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) concepts.** From there, we dive into the "Dual Role" of AI:
1.  **AI as an Offensive Weapon**: Understanding how adversaries use AI to automate attacks and sophisticated social engineering.
2.  **AI as a Defensive Shield**: Leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to detect, prevent, and remediate threats at scale.

## What You Will Learn
*   **Foundations**: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning vocabularies.
*   **Data Processing**: Cleaning and exploring real-world security datasets (e.g., CICIDS2017).
*   **Advanced Techniques**: Clustering, Neural Networks, Sequential Models (LSTMs, Transformers), and LLMs.
*   **Practical Skills**: Hands-on labs building classifiers for Phishing, DDoS, and Malware detection.
